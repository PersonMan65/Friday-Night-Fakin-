# Friday-Night-Fakin-
A Friday Night Funkin' bot that is able to play songs for you with little to no maintenance. This bot is based on reading pixels and works for most mods as long as they don't change arrow positions or colors. Because of the pixel-based part, this has to be played at default resolution without fullscreen.  This bot works well enough as far as tested and will be improved and sped up in the future. Tell me if you have any issues and I will try to solve them ASAP. Now have fun!  Instructions: 1. Unzip the zip file to whatever location 2. Open Friday Night Funkin' 3. Open the Friday Night Fakin' exe file 4. Give it the name of the fnf file WITHOUT the extension (exe, etc.) 5. Open any compatible song and play
